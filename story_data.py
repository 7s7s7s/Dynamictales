""In the shadows, the unseen holds the key,"" the Oracle's words echoed in their mind, a taunting reminder of the path they had chosen. They had hoped that this cryptic advice would provide them with the strength to vanquish their foe. But as they stared into the abyss, their own heart heavy and burdened, they couldn't help but feel that the answer had eluded them. As the mechanical monstrosity bore down on them, Alex fought desperately, but the overwhelming force proved too much to endure. With one final, crushing blow, their vision blurred, and they crumpled to the ground. The life seemed to drain from their body, leaving them in the cold embrace of the ancient stones.
